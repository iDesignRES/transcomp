This model is designed for the regional analysis of the energy demand of the transport sector, considering modal and technological shift as well as vehicle stock dynamics. For its application, it is flexible in the scope of analysis in terms of considered transport segments, level of granularity in the representation of these transport segments and the granularity of representation of different consumer groups.
